(you can read a better solution [here](/blog/private-queries-with-apollo-server-express))

The GraphQL Spec that defines [how errors should be handled](http://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Errors). That means Apollo Server cannot send 401 server error, each request sent http status 200. Even if you have an authenticate issue, it  will return a JSON with http status 200. My plan to handle it is to create two shemas, one private and one public.

## Apollo Server middleware problem

The [type-graphql](https://typegraphql.com/docs/middlewares.html#attaching-middleware) middleware will return an http status 200 with a JSON with the UNAUTHENTICATED error code.

```typescript {4}
@Resolver()
class UserResolver {
  @Query(() => [User])
  @UseMiddleware(isAuth)
  users() {
    return User.find();
  }
}
```

## Create Apollo Server Schema

This is the private schema. The line 3 has the route for the private queries and mutations. The line 9 has the path name, it means the endpoint will be in `locahost:4000/graphql/private`. For the public you have to do the same, change the resolvers path and the path. In my case I have `/graphql/private`for the private resolvers and `/graphql/public` for the public ones.

```typescript {3,9}
const server = async (app: Express) => {
  const apolloSchema = await buildSchema({
    resolvers: [path.join(__dirname, '../../../graphql/private/**/*.ts')],
    validate: false,
  });
  const apolloServer = new ApolloServer({ schema: apolloSchema });
  apolloServer.applyMiddleware({
    app,
    path: '/graphql/private',
  });
};
```

## Create Middleware

This is the middleware to block `/graphql/private` from unauthenticated users. Unfortunately, the "application-level middleware" in ExpressJS [does not show](https://github.com/expressjs/express/blob/master/lib/router/layer.js#L111) all application information within middleware. But, at least I found a way to see the current request url.

```typescript
const isAuthMiddleware = async (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  const url = req.params[0] ?? '';
  if (url !== '/graphql/private') {
    next();
    return;
  }
  getUserByOauthToken(req).then((user) => {
    Auth.setUser(user);
    next();
  }).catch((error) => {
    if (error instanceof AuthenticationError) {
      res.status(401).send({ message: error.message });
    } else {
      res.status(500).send({ message: error.message });
    }
  });
};
```

## Add the GraphQL server and Middleware to Express

This is the express app, the private and public Apollo Server was added. And the `isAuthMiddleware` to allow authenticated users only for the url `graphql/private`.

```typescript
const getApp = async (): Promise<Express> => {
  const app = express();
  app.use('*', isAuthMiddleware);
  await privateServer(app);
  await publicServer(app);
  return app;
};
```

Finally the solution was to create a private Apollo Server schema, only allow requests for authenticated users. That means that all queries and mutations in that schema will be private. You can see the code in my [repo](https://github.com/albertcito/nodejs-web-typescript).
